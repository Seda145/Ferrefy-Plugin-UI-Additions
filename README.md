### Introduction
---

I made this plugin for Unreal Engine. 

It adds new widget types and input functionality. It is used to efficiently build common and advanced UI, with a consistent user input and feedback behavior.

It adds essential new features such as widget lazy loading, a highly customizable cursor type, input device recognition and response, and among more widgets, a menu system that routes navigation between menus. Menus offer improved control over widget focusing.

A HUD is provided which centralizes and automates management of widgets, cursor behavior, and player controller input modes. It guards against undesired focus loss on widgets.

UI navigation input is now configurable from the project settings. These input actions and few more intended to implement a consistent UI experience with are automatically added and validated.

Behavior of existing UI elements (Slate) has been improved through the additions, to create a better and more similar experience when using gamepad, keyboard and mouse input devices. Unreal Engine's "Enhanced Input" is not used.

Some example images show UI content of my Custom Settings Plugin, which was built with this plugin.

### Documentation
---

[Read the documentation on my website](https://ferrefy.com/documentation/ui-additions-plugin/)

The documentation covers plugin requirements, installation, features, media, examples, the compact "how and why" of class implementations, and more.

It also lists dependencies. Dependencies are other Ferrefy or Unreal Engine plugins that are required for this plugin to work. 

---
### Availability
---

Unlike some Ferrefy plugins, this plugin is not yet available on FAB. You can currently download it here from Github and read the included readme, license and other documentation to get started. 

This plugin can not be published on FAB, because EPIC's build pipeline is not advanced enough. It seems not to be in their interest to modernize. EPIC / FAB can not process plugins that have (non UE) plugin dependencies, which makes it impossible to publish modular software there. 

To professional software developers, software modularity is a necessity. That is why I decided to still publish this plugin (and others), but on Github, for free.

To support me and future software development, you can buy [Ferrefy plugins on FAB](https://www.fab.com/sellers/Ferrefy).

### About me
---

Hi! I'm Roy Wierer. I am a solo developer specialized in game and website programming. I enjoy being creative. When not programming, I'm likely working on visual art or playing musical instruments. A mix of many skills and interests, and a high level of specialization, makes me effective as a developer. I'm there from vision to end product. My Github nickname "Seda145", which I used for personal projects became well known with project [Road To The North](https://www.moddb.com/mods/zoneexpanded-road-to-the-north). 

I decided to make game development my full-time job because it offers full freedom to combine my skill set. I began developing plugins for Unreal Engine, then registered my own company, [Ferrefy](https://ferrefy.com). As Ferrefy I participate on marketplaces like [FAB](https://www.fab.com/sellers/Ferrefy). 

As Ferrefy, I release highly modular systems as Unreal Engine plugins. Plugins that excel in usability both independently and when combined into larger systems. I provide the parts, the tools and features, for your project.
